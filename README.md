# Biopython-Tutorial-Project

This project demonstrates how to use [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) for sequence analysis and bioinformatics tasks.  
It includes examples of DNA/RNA sequence manipulation, visualization, and basic computational biology operations.

## Features
- Read and manipulate DNA/RNA sequences
- Perform basic bioinformatics analysis using Biopython
- Visualize biological data with Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Structured in Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/biopython-sequence-analysis.git
cd biopython-sequence-analysis
